# Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the submission for the **Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data** hackathon, focusing on leveraging Generative AI for real-time data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional AI models struggle with real-time data adaptability, leading to outdated insights and inefficient decision-making. Our solution aims to address this gap with an AI-powered, self-improving data intelligence platform.

## 💡 Solution
We propose a **Generative AI-powered Data Intelligence Platform** that:
- Continuously learns from new data.
- Enhances predictive analytics through real-time processing.
- Provides AI-driven insights for business decisions.
- Ensures data security and ethical AI compliance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning & NLP**: OpenAI GPT, Llama, or custom LLMs
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Hadoop
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Security & Compliance**: Federated Learning, Differential Privacy
